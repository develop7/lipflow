# Lipflow

**Wispr Flow for your lips.** Hold a key, silently mouth what you want to say, let go, and the
text shows up at your cursor in whatever app you're in. No microphone and no sound, just your webcam.

Everything runs locally on your Mac, Windows PC, or Linux machine. An optional LLM pass fixes the words lip reading gets wrong.

```

## Setup

Needs an Apple Silicon Mac on macOS 13 or later (macOS 26 for the Liquid Glass look), and about 2 GB of disk.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/amywork777/lipflow.git ~/code/lipflow
cd ~/code/lipflow && ./setup.sh     # installs uv deps, ~1.2 GB of models, builds /Applications/Lipflow.app
open /Applications/Lipflow.app
```

The first launch opens setup, which takes about 8 minutes:

1. **Permissions:** Camera, Input Monitoring and Accessibility, each asked once for "Lipflow".
   The app is a small signed program that loads this checkout in-process, so those
   permissions belong to Lipflow rather than to Python. If a switch is on in System
   Settings but setup still shows it off, click **Restart Lipflow** under Continue.
2. **Your words:** if you use Wispr Flow, it imports your dictation history (read locally, never
   uploaded) to learn your phrasing and the names you say.
3. **Practice:** you silently mouth 24 sentences (taken from your own history when available).
4. **Train:** it fine-tunes the language model on your phrasing and the lip reader on your face,
   on this Mac's GPU. Six practice sentences are held out, and the face model is only kept if it
   reads them better than the stock model. You see the before/after score.

Re-run it any time from the menu → *Set up / train on my face…*. More practice clips help more.
Everything personal (clips, phrases, trained models) lives in
`~/Library/Application Support/Lipflow/`. Delete that folder to start over.

To start Lipflow at login: System Settings → General → Login Items → add Lipflow. Logs are in
`~/Library/Logs/Lipflow.log`. Running from a terminal (`uv run lipflow`) also works, but then
macOS asks for permissions in the terminal's name.

### Windows

Needs Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit) and about 3 GB of disk. In PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/amywork777/lipflow.git $HOME\code\lipflow
cd $HOME\code\lipflow
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1   # uv deps, ~1.2 GB of models, Start menu shortcut
```

Then open **Lipflow** from the Start menu. It lives in the system tray (the pink mouth by the
clock; click ^ if it's hidden). The first launch opens the same setup as on a Mac, minus
permissions: your Wispr Flow words, 24 practice sentences, then training on your face.

How it differs from the Mac version:

- **Key:** hold **Right Ctrl** (change it in the tray menu → *Push-to-talk key*: Right Alt / AltGr,
  Left Alt or Right Shift also work). Double-tap for hands-free and Esc to cancel work the same.
- **Camera:** if it doesn't come on, turn on Settings → Privacy & security → Camera → *Let desktop
  apps access your camera*. Pick another camera by number in the tray menu.
- **Speed:** without an NVIDIA GPU the lip reader runs on the processor, so expect a second or two
  more per sentence than on a Mac (on an M4 Pro the encoder takes 1.7 s on CPU vs 0.16 s on the
  GPU), and training on your face takes several times longer. With an NVIDIA card, install the
  CUDA build of PyTorch: `uv pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126`
  (re-run it after `uv sync`, which puts the CPU build back).
- **Cleanup:** the in-process local model is Mac-only (MLX), so use Claude (`setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY …`,
  then restart Lipflow) or [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (`ollama pull qwen3:4b`). Without either,
  Lipflow uses the offline rules.
- **Names from context:** taken from the window title only (on a Mac it also reads the text
  around your cursor). Learning from your corrections is Mac-only for now.
- **Start with Windows:** tray menu → *Start with Windows*. Your data lives in `%APPDATA%\Lipflow`
  (log: `Lipflow.log` there). `uv run lipflow doctor` checks the models and camera.

### Linux / GNOME 50

The Linux frontend is written in Rust with GTK4/libadwaita and reuses the existing Python ML
engine. It targets **GNOME 50 on Wayland**, including openSUSE Tumbleweed with NVIDIA GPUs.
It includes dictation, portal-approved automatic paste, whisper mode, practice and training,
custom words, phrase import, history, notifications, and autostart.

Download the CUDA-enabled Flatpak (x86_64, with CPU fallback) from a successful
**Actions → Linux Flatpak** run's **Lipflow-linux-x86_64-cuda** artifact. See the
[installation instructions](linux/README.md#flatpak). To build locally:

```sh
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak-builder --user --install-deps-from=flathub --force-clean --install \
  linux/flatpak/build linux/flatpak/io.github.develop7.Lipflow.json
flatpak run io.github.develop7.Lipflow
```

In **Preferences**, connect desktop permissions, then download/load the models from **Dictate**.
Hold **Ctrl+Alt+Space**, mouth your words, and release. Double-tap for hands-free; **Ctrl+Alt+Esc**
cancels. GNOME's portal settings can change those shortcuts. Automatic paste needs keyboard and
clipboard consent; the window hides while dictating so the receiving app can retain focus.

See [Linux build, development, and verification instructions](linux/README.md), including
NVIDIA setup, data locations, and the remaining checks on a real GNOME desktop. Linux uses a
native window and notifications; automatic learning from edits inside other apps remains a
macOS feature. The research-only model weights download separately.

### Most accurate: whisper mode

Settings → **Whisper mode**. While you hold the key, Lipflow also listens to a soft whisper and
reads lips + audio together with the Auto-AVSR audio-visual model (downloaded the first time,
1.8 GB). On test sentences, lips alone got 31.9% of words wrong; lips + audio got 6.9%. A real
whisper is less clear than those test clips, so expect somewhere in between. The mic is only on
while you hold the key.

### Learning from your corrections

When you fix a word Lipflow typed (within about 30 seconds), it saves that clip with your
corrected sentence, and the next *Practice & train more* round uses it. Only the text field it
pasted into is read. Switch it off in Settings.

### Better accuracy: turn on LLM cleanup

Lip reading can't tell apart words that look the same on the lips (p/b/m, f/v, t/d/n…), so the raw
model output reads like "WALLET OFFICER" when you said "while in office". Lipflow sends the model's
top-3 guesses plus your last few dictations to an LLM, which picks the sentence you meant and
fixes casing, punctuation and numbers. The first backend that's available is used:

1. **Claude**: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=…` (model `claude-opus-5-5` at low effort; override with
   `LIPFLOW_MODEL`, e.g. `LIPFLOW_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5` for lower latency). Best at fixing badly
   mis-read sentences.
2. **Local** (the default without a key): Qwen3-0.6B 4-bit running in-process on Apple Silicon
   via MLX. About 350 MB, downloaded on first launch, and about 0.2 s per sentence, fully offline.
   Tiny models copy the formatting they're shown, so this one gets lowercase guesses and a few
   worked examples (`SMALL_SHOTS` in `cleanup.py`). Override with `LIPFLOW_LOCAL_MODEL`.
3. **Ollama**: `--cleanup ollama` with `ollama pull qwen3:4b` (override with `LIPFLOW_OLLAMA_MODEL`).
4. **Offline rules**: sentence case, "I", end punctuation, "nineteen forty three" → 1943.

**Learn from your Wispr Flow history.** Most of what you'll mouth is stuff you already say.

```sh
uv run lipflow import-wispr     # or: --from-text my-writing.txt
```

This reads Wispr Flow's local database read-only, prints only counts, and saves your phrases to
`~/Library/Application Support/Lipflow/phrases.txt`. Nothing leaves your Mac. Lipflow then:
picks between the lip-reader's top 5 guesses using a small model of the word pairs you use;
shows the cleanup model your past sentences closest to what it read; and adds names you
capitalise often to your custom words for review. Restart Lipflow afterwards.

**Custom words.** Names are the hardest thing to lip-read (a name is just lip shapes). Put yours
in the Lipflow menu → *Edit custom words*, one per line (`~/Library/Application Support/Lipflow/words.txt`).
A guess that contains one of your words wins over the others and gets your capitalization, and
the LLM is told about them.

## Using it

| Do this | To |
|---|---|
| Hold **Right Option**, mouth the words, release | dictate |
| Double-tap **Right Option** … tap again | hands-free (up to 60 s) |
| **Esc** while listening | cancel |
| Lipflow menu → Copy last dictation / Open history | get text back |

Lipflow keeps filming for 0.4 s after you release the key, because the model needs the frames
after the last word to read it.

Options: `uv run lipflow --help`

```
--key {right_option,left_option,right_command,right_control,fn}
--cleanup {auto,claude,local,ollama,basic}
--beam N          beam size (default 10)
--copy-only       copy to the clipboard instead of pasting
--camera N|FILE   camera index, or a video file to stand in for the webcam
```

Lip-read a video file: `uv run lipflow file talk.mp4 --start 10 --end 20`

## How it works

- **Model:** [Auto-AVSR](https://github.com/mpc001/auto_avsr) visual-only speech recognition trained
  on LRS3 (19.1% WER on the benchmark). A 3D-conv ResNet front end and a Conformer encoder feed a
  Transformer decoder plus CTC, with a subword Transformer language model in the beam search.
- **Preprocessing:** MediaPipe FaceLandmarker runs on every frame *while you're recording*, so
  there's no second detection pass afterwards. Eye, nose-base and mouth anchors are aligned to the
  training mean face, then 96×96 grayscale mouth crops are resampled to the 25 fps the model expects.
- **Speed (M4 Pro, 9 s utterance):** encoder 0.16 s on the Apple GPU (it's 1.7 s on CPU), beam
  search about 0.8–1.6 s on CPU (faster than MPS for thousands of tiny ops), for about 1–2 s from
  release to text. Two patches to the vendored ESPnet help: cross-attention keys/values are
  projected once per utterance instead of per hypothesis per step (25% faster beam search), and CTC
  scoring works on any device.

Accuracy on held-out news footage (public-domain White House addresses), raw model output:

| Said | Read |
|---|---|
| Born in New York City, and raised mostly in Chicago, Nancy Davis graduated from Smith College in 1943. | BORN IN NEW YORK CITY AND RAISED MOSTLY IN CHICAGO NANCY DAVIS GRADUATED FROM SMITH COLLEGE IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE |
| …a real-life Hollywood romance with the love of her life, Ronald Reagan, whom she married in 1952. | ROMANCE WITH THE LOVE OF HER LIFE RONALD REAGAN WHOM SHE MARRIED IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO |
| Presidents have delivered some form of final message while in office - a farewell address to the American people. | PRESIDENTS HAVE DELIVERED SOME FORM OF FINAL MESSAGE WHILE IN OFFICE FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE |

Silently mouthed speech is harder than filmed speech (smaller lip movements), so expect more
errors on your own webcam. That's what the LLM cleanup is for.

## Development

```sh
./setup.sh --samples      # also fetch the public-domain test clips
uv run pytest             # the paste test is opt-in: LIPFLOW_TEST_PASTE=1
```

On Windows: `setup.ps1 -Samples`, then `uv run pytest`. CI runs the whole Windows setup and reads
a real clip on every push (`.github/workflows/windows.yml`).

(Quartz event tap; pynput's macOS listener crashes on recent macOS), `paste.py`, `hud.py`,
`cleanup.py`, `app.py` (wiring + menu bar). Windows: `lipflow/win/` (tray app, overlay, setup
window, pynput key hook, clipboard paste). Shared by both: `ptt.py` (key timing), `dictation.py`,
